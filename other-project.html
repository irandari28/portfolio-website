                        <h2>What is the test
                            about?</h2>
                        <p>Creativity is needed in many, if not all, aspects
                            of life. In many sectors, it's the component that
                            takes us further toward the next step of problem
                            solving iterations.
                            E. Paul Torrance defined creativity as a process.
                            Creative thinking takes place in the process of
                            sensing gaps and problems in life, making
                            guesses or formulating hypotheses about these
                            problems, retesting as well as modifying them
                            and finally communicating the result.
                            Given the importance of creativity in navigating
                            life as well as in sustaining economic growth, we
                            were interested in developing a test that could
                            measure the intricacy of individual creative
                            process.
                            This test measures the verbal creativity,
                            someone's creative capability expressed through
                            verbal content.</p>
                        <h2>The Background</h2>
                        <p>E. Paul Torrance was a pioneer in
                            creativity research and education for more
                            than 50 years. He developed the creativity
                            test called Torrance Test of Creative
                            Thinking (TTCT).</p>
                        <p>TTCT is not operated under the
                            comprehensive definition as stated by
                            Torrance (Chase, 1985). Torrance made no
                            statement that the test itself can be used
                            to assess all dimensions of creativity or to
                            even suggest the test be used as the sole
                            basis for decision making (Treffinger,
                            1985). TTCT score doesn't guarantee it will
                            be translated into behavior. With this
                            disclaimer in mind, the framework of
                            creativity and structure of TTCT given by
                            Torrance could still offer a great value to
                            be used for adaption.</p>
                        <h2>Test
                            Specification</h2>
                        <p>This test is composed of 2 sub-tests. Sub-
                            test A consists of 10 items and sub-test B
                            
                            consists of 5 items. The difference
                            between the two sub-sets lies in the type
                            of stimulus given to test takers. Sub-test A
                            is made up of verbal items and sub-test B
                            contains graphic items. Responses to
                            these items are written by the test takers
                            and assessed by testers based on the
                            dimensions of creativity under Torrance's
                            framework: fluency, flexibility, and
                            originality. Empirical evidence of the
                            reliability and validity of this test is
                            provided in the manual.</p>
                        <p>Verbal Creativity level derived from the
                            score in this test ranges from Expressive to
                            Emergent with scores between 50 and 55.</p>
                        <h2>Purpose of The Test</h2>
                        <p>This test can be used in educational
                            setting as well as the industry especially in
                            the copywriting and editing field.
                            Hiring managers can utilize the test to
                            select candidates for the job fit,
                            educators can use the test to map
                            students' creative skill, and researchers
                            can also use the test for further studies in
                            creative thinking.</p>
